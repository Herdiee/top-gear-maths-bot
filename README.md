# top-gear-maths-bot
This is a discord bot made in discord.py, the python scripting for the discord API. It's catered specifically towards an amazing server Top Maths Gear Shed, focused towards mainly helping people with their math, and just hanging out. It has basic moderation functions, welcome messages, suggest functions, and a tutor function that pings all tutors that are available. Still in developement.
